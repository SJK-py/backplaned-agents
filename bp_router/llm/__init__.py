"""bp_router.llm — Centralised LLM service.

Promoted from "embedded agent" to a router-side service so:
- Provider API keys never leave the router process.
- Quotas and budgets are enforced consistently across providers.
- Telemetry (tokens, cost, latency) is uniform.

See `docs/sdk/services.md` §1 for the agent-facing contract.
